# IMDb-Analysis
Developed a Python project using pandas, numpy, plotnine, and scikit-learn libraries to analyze and provide insight on the relationship between various movie variables and IMDb scores. Using a dataset found on Kaggle, I coded a linear regression model, PCA model, and use KMeans to answer questions I had created for this specific project.
